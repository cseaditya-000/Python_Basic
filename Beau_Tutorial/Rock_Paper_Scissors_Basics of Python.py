#2>Calling functions
#choices = get_choices()        #fuction being called
#print(choices)
#print(get_choices()) #direct use

#3>Dictionaries--Used to store data value and key-value pairs.We could use variable name without quotes.
#dict = {"name":"beau","color":"blue"}            #This is a dictionary.Name is key and beau is value.

#4> Libraries, Lists, Methods
#How we can import random library
#a list in python is used to store multiple item in a single variable
# Libraries, Lists, Methods
#How we can import random library

#food = ["pizza","carrots","eggs",3]#this is a list of strings
#dinner = random.choice(food)
#function arguments

#5 If statments
#a=3#single equal sign is a assign operator in python
#b=5
#if a == b:#double equal sign is used to check if two values are equal
#    print("yes")

#6 f-string
#age=25
#print(f"Jim is {age} years old.")

#7 if else
#age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
#if age >= 18:
#    print("You are an adult.")
#elif age>12:
#    print("You are a teenager")
#elif age>1:
#    print("You are a child")
#else:
#    print("You are a baby.")
